After spending few days, finally able to figure socket disconnect detection in .NET ðŸ™‚ 

Â 

Public Shared Function IsConnected(ByVal socket As Socket) As Boolean  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Try  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Return Not (socket.Poll(1, SelectMode.SelectRead) AndAlso socket.Available = 0)  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Catch generatedExceptionName As SocketException  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Return False  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  End Try  
End Function

In Timer_tick event, keep checking for connection status.Â  If return value is â€˜falseâ€™, we can say that socket is disconnected now ðŸ™‚
