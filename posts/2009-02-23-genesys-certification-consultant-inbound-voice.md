I am glad to inform you that I cleared Genesys certification with 90% :-). It was one of the tough exams which I faced so far.

One need to have good understanding of Genesys Framework & Architecture and functions of each components. Most importantly, if you have at-least one implementation experience, you can easily clear the certification.

All the best and Cheers ðŸ™‚
