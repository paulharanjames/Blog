Whenever URS default routes calls, it will be logged with **‘EventRouteUsed(strange)’** 

You can simply search for this string to identify call flows which resulted in default route or use ‘find in files’ option from text editor to calculate number of calls which were default routed.![Smile](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Jxic3VtC-TI/UOxMIYwaziI/AAAAAAAAACI/8CU4_cbST-E/wlEmoticon-smile%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800)
