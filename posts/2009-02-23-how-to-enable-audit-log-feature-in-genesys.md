I have been asked many ‘how to’ questions by junior team members and thought that I will share it with everyone here..

You can enable ‘Audit logs’ in just three steps

  * Configure **‘Configuration Server’** to be managed by Management Framework. For assistance on configuring configuration server, please refer to post **[‘Configure Configuration Server in CME’](http://ctiworld.wordpress.com/2009/02/23/configure-configuration-server-in-cme/)** 
  * Enable **network** logging for **trace** level for **‘Configuration Server’** and **‘SCS’**. 
  * As always for network logging, add connection to ‘Message Server’ from Configuration Server and SCS 

I will be posting other tips and tricks shortly. If you have any tips to share or would like to know about tips on any components, let me know
