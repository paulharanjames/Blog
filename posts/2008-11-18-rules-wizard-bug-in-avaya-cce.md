**Avaya CCE** Product team is identified a new bug in &#8216;Rules Wizard&#8217; component Â in version 3.0.3 update 01 and possible work-around solution for the same.

When using the **Rules Wizard** to edit an existing rule, the end result may be the new rule appended to the existing rule and the rule will not work.

The only work around at this stage is to edit the rule directly in **Configuration Manager** or in the **&#8220;.ini&#8221;** file for CCE Desktop.
